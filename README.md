ERVcancer: A web resource designed for querying human endogenous retrovirus activation across major cancer types

Human endogenous retroviral sequences (HERVs) compose approximately 8% of the human genome, co-opted into the dynamic regulatory network of cellular potency in early embryonic development. In recent studies, resurgent HERVsâ€™ transcriptional activity has been frequently observed in many types of human cancer, suggesting their potential functions in the occurrence and progression of malignancy. However, a web resource dedicated to querying the relationship between activation of HERVs and cancer development is lacking. Here, we have constructed a database to explore the sequence information, expression profiles, survival prognosis, and genetic interactions of HERVs in diverse cancer types. Our database currently incorporates data from 581 HERVs across 16246 samples, comprising 151 early embryonic samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, 8051 human adult tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, 932 cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project, 6478 tumors and 634 normal tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. The primary goal is to provide an easily accessible and user-friendly database for professionals in the fields of bioinformatics, pathology, pharmacology, and related areas, enabling them to efficiently screen the activity of HERVs of interest in normal and cancerous tissues and evaluate the clinical relevance. The ERVcancer database is available at http://kyuanlab.com/ervcancer/.
